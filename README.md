Welcome (:

Tennis-match-client is the backend part of my final project at Ironhack Lisbon. 

While working with React in the Frontend, it was interesting and challenging to check the POST and GET routes only through Postman.

Since time was short I focused on the main MVP functionalities such as the login/sign up verification, profile update, picture upload, and the main features which are liking, disliking and matching with other users. 

I plan on continuing working on this project in order to enhance the user experience and the user interface, as well as implement new functionalities. 

Of course, the project would not have existed without the help of professor Miguel and assistant professor Stefano. 

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB (Mongoose) are used in the project.
